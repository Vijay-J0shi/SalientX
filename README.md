## Concepts

- Inputs: Image, salient and background prompt
- Resize Image to (512, 512) but maintaining the ratio
- Send the resize image to `SAM` based model
- Send the prompt image and result of `SAM` based model to `Stable Diffusion` + `ControlNet` model

### ⚠️ Note on EVF-SAM Usage

We have borrowed some code from the official [EVF-SAM](https://github.com/hustvl/EVF-SAM) repository. Initially, our team intended to integrate EVF-SAM directly via the Hugging Face `transformers` library using:

```python
AutoModel.from_pretrained("...")
```

However, as of now, EVF-SAM does not support loading through `AutoModel.from_pretrained`. For reference, you can check the related Hugging Face model page: [EVF-SAM-MULTITASK](https://huggingface.co/YxZhang/evf-sam2-multitask).
